# FFPR_CustomTitleScreen
A BepInEx dll that replaces the white background of the title screen of the FINAL FANTASY PIXEL REMASTERS to an image of your choosing

# Installation:
1. Install a Bleeding-Edge build of BepInEx 6, which can be found [here](https://builds.bepis.io/projects/bepinex_be) or used from a prior Memoria installation
